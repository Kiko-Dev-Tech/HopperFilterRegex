# HopperFilter
Eliminate complicated hopper setups with this little plugin. Filter items through hoppers by simply renaming the hopper in an anvil and placing it. Filter by specific strings, tags, enchantments, use hopper minecarts and more. Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/jwkerr/HopperFilter/wiki) for help and guides.

HopperFilter has been designed from the ground up to be as performant as possible. Any pull requests improving performance are welcome.

# Extra Feature
- Regex Syntax support with "r:{regex}" 
<br> e.g. r:^(diamond|emerald|iron_ingot|gold_ingot|netherite_ingot|netherite_scrap|lapis_lazuli|quartz|amethyst_shard|copper_ingot)$
<br> This filters for diamond, emeralds etc.
<br> To write regex you can use [Regex101](https://regex101.com)
- Config file /plugins/HopperFilter/config.yml
- Edit move rate for all hopper types (via config)
- Now move item from every slot in the inventory if it matches
