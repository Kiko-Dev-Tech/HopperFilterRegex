# HopperFilter
Eliminate complicated hopper setups with this little plugin. Filter items through hoppers by simply renaming the hopper in an anvil and placing it. Filter by specific strings, tags, enchantments, use hopper minecarts and more. Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/jwkerr/HopperFilter/wiki) for help and guides.

HopperFilter has been designed from the ground up to be as performant as possible. Any pull requests improving performance are welcome.
